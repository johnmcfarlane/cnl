[CNL](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl) is a numerics library written in C++
which aims to do for `int` what the STL does for arrays.
Its main roles are to help:

* approximate real numbers using fixed-point arithmetic;
* detect and prevent overflow and
* increase precision through alternative rounding modes.

A compositional design promotes seamless interoperability between numeric types.
And by providing the thinnest wrappers over the widest range of numeric types,
CNL aims to assist the development of:

* large-scale simulations including video games and scientific models;
* resource-constrained applications on embedded and mobile devices and
* math-intensive operations on specialized hardware such as GPUs and FPGAs.

The library's APIs are developed in colaboration with standardization 
bodies such as [The C++ Standards Committee](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/)
and members of [The Kronos Group Inc.](https://www.khronos.org/)
and it serves as a reference implementation for sections of the 
[C++ Numbers Technical Specification](http://wg21.link/p0101).
Please read proposals, [P0037](http://wg21.link/p0037) 
and [P0554](http://wg21.link/p0554) for more details.

## Download

The library is [hosted](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl) on GitHub:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl.git
```

The API is exposed through headers in the [include](./include/) directory.
Add this to your system header list and include, e.g.:

```c++
#include <cnl/fixed_point.h>
```

## Tests and Benchmarks

### Linux

Tested on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/johnmcfarlane/cnl) (Ubuntu 14.04) 
using GCC 5+ and Clang 3.5+. 

Requires:

- GCC 5.1 / Clang 3.5
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.2

Optional:

- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) - facilitates multiprecision support
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) - generates documentation in the *doc/gh-pages* directory
- [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) - generates proposal papers

To run tests:

```shell
$ cmake
$ make fp_test
$ src/test/fp_test
```

To run benchmarks:

```shell
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make fp_benchmark
$ src/benchmark/fp_benchmark
```

#### Windows

Tested on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/johnmcfarlane/cnl/branch/develop)
and on *Windows 10 Professional* with *CMake 3.8.0*. Requires:

- MSBuild 15.0 (VS 2017)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.8.0

To build *vs/Release/fp_test.exe* and *vs/Release/fp_benchmark.exe*:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" .
    MSBuild.exe /m cnl.sln /p:Configuration=Release

For 64-bit builds, append `Win64` to the `-G` option above:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" .

Note that *fp_benchmark* is unlikely to produce valid results due to missing `escape` and `clobber` functions.
