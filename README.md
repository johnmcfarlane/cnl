[CNL](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl) is a numerics library written in C++
which aims to do for `int` what the STL does for arrays.
Its main roles are to help:

* approximate real numbers using fixed-point arithmetic;
* detect and prevent overflow and
* increase precision through alternative rounding modes.

A compositional design promotes seamless interoperability between numeric types.
And by providing the thinnest wrappers over the widest range of numeric types,
CNL aims to assist the development of:

* large-scale simulations including video games and scientific models;
* resource-constrained applications on embedded and mobile devices and
* math-intensive operations on specialized hardware such as GPUs and FPGAs.

## Requirements

### Linux

Tested on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/johnmcfarlane/cnl) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/johnmcfarlane/cnl).

Requires:

- GCC 5.1 / Clang 3.5
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) ([3.0.2](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/cpp/#CMake))

Optional:

- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) - facilitates multiprecision support
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) - generates documentation in the *doc/gh-pages* directory

### Windows

Tested on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/johnmcfarlane/cnl/branch/develop)
and on *Windows 10 Professional* with *CMake 3.8.0*. Requires:

- MSBuild 15.0 (VS 2017)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.8.0

## Instructions

### Download

The library is [hosted](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl) on GitHub:

```shell
cd /some/directory
git clone https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl.git
```

### Build

CNL is a header-only library so there is no need to build it.
However, it comes with a number of tests and benchmarks.

#### Running Tests

1. Generate the build system:

   `cmake /some/directory/cnl`

2. Build tests:

   * For Linux (in parallel using *N* cores):

     `cmake --build . --target Tests -- -j N`

   * For Windows:

     `cmake --build . --target src/test/Tests`

3. Run tests:

   `ctest`

#### Running Benchmarks

1. Generate the build system (optimized):

   `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release /some/directory/cnl`

2. Build benchmarks:

   `cmake --build . --target Benchmark`

3. Run benchmarks:

   `src/benchmark/Benchmark`

#### Additional build system generation options:

1. To describe CNL build options:

   `cmake -LH /some/directory/cnl`

2. Then to apply an option, e.g. to disabled exceptions:

   `cmake -DEXCEPTIONS=OFF /some/directory/cnl`

### Integration

The API is exposed through headers in the [include](./include/) directory.
Add this to your system header list and include, e.g.:

```c++
// to use a specific type:
#include <cnl/fixed_point.h>

// or to include all CNL types:
#include <cnl/all.h>
```

## Example Projects

Examples of projects using CNL:

* [CDSP](https://github.com/hbe72/cdsp) - Compositional DSP Library for 
  C++;
* [cnl_example](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl_example) - minimal
  CMake-based project which uses CNL as a dependency.
